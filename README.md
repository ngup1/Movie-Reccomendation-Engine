# Movie-Reccomendation-Engine
A repository showing my movie recommendation project with machine learning!

Goals for this project: 
My goal for this project was to expose myself to machine learning and develop a basic understanding of machine learning problem solving, technologies, and implementation. I wanted to create something that I could see being functional in a larger application, and gain experience working with large data sets. 

How its made: 
Technologies used included Python, Scikit-learn.
